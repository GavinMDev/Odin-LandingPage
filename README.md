# Odin-LandingPage
Odin Project - Landing Page Project

The aim of this project was to create a landing page similar to the images provided in the project repository. I created a index.html homepage and a css page to style it. There was no JS needed for this project. I took a spin on the example image by creating a fictional pet social media website. I used Pexels to get free images to use for the webpage.
